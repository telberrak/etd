The most effective time reversal patterns in trading are typically candlestick patterns and chart patterns that signal potential reversals in price trends. Here are some of the most reliable ones:

1. Candlestick Patterns

Hammer: A single candle with a small body at the top and a long lower wick. It often appears at the bottom of a downtrend, suggesting a bullish reversal.

Shooting Star: The opposite of a hammer, it has a small body near the bottom and a long upper wick. It often appears at the top of an uptrend, suggesting a bearish reversal.

Engulfing Patterns:

Bullish Engulfing: A small bearish candle followed by a large bullish candle that fully engulfs the previous one, indicating a potential reversal from downtrend to uptrend.

Bearish Engulfing: A small bullish candle followed by a larger bearish candle, signaling a possible trend change from uptrend to downtrend.


Doji: A candlestick where the open and close are virtually the same, forming a cross shape. It shows indecision in the market and often appears before a reversal, especially when combined with other patterns.

Evening Star/Morning Star: Three-candle patterns indicating a reversal. The evening star signals bearish reversal, and the morning star signals bullish reversal.


2. Chart Patterns

Head and Shoulders: A chart pattern with three peaks, where the middle peak (the "head") is higher than the two side peaks ("shoulders"). It signals a bearish reversal after an uptrend. The inverse head and shoulders is the bullish counterpart.

Double Top and Double Bottom: Two consecutive peaks (double top) or troughs (double bottom) at similar levels. A double top signals a bearish reversal, while a double bottom signals a bullish reversal.

Triple Top and Triple Bottom: Similar to the double top and bottom, but with three peaks or troughs. It strengthens the reversal signal.

Rounding Top and Bottom: Gradual, curved price movement that suggests a slow trend reversal. A rounding top signals bearish reversal, and a rounding bottom signals bullish reversal.


3. Key Reversal Days

Key Reversal Up/Down: This pattern appears on individual days, where the market makes a new low/high and then reverses to close higher/lower than the previous close. It suggests a strong shift in momentum.


4. Support and Resistance Breakouts

A strong break of a support or resistance level can signal a potential reversal, especially when accompanied by high trading volume.


Using Reversal Patterns Effectively

Combining reversal patterns with other indicators, such as volume, trendlines, moving averages, or momentum indicators (like RSI), often improves accuracy. The effectiveness of each pattern can vary depending on the time frame and asset type, so it's wise to confirm patterns with other technical signals before making trading decisions.

To write a Pine Script that identifies potential reversals in TradingView, you can start by coding some common reversal patterns, such as bullish/bearish engulfing, hammer, and shooting star candlestick patterns. Here’s a basic script that detects these patterns and highlights them on a chart:

//@version=5
indicator("Potential Reversal Patterns", overlay=true)

// Input options for pattern detection
lookback = input.int(1, "Lookback Period", minval=1)

// Bullish and Bearish Engulfing Patterns
bullishEngulfing = close > open and close[1] < open[1] and close > open[1] and open < close[1]
bearishEngulfing = close < open and close[1] > open[1] and close < open[1] and open > close[1]

// Hammer and Shooting Star Patterns
isHammer = (close - low) / (high - low) > 0.7 and (high - low) > (close - open) * 2 and close > open
isShootingStar = (high - close) / (high - low) > 0.7 and (high - low) > (open - close) * 2 and close < open

// Plot signals on chart
plotshape(bullishEngulfing, title="Bullish Engulfing", location=location.belowbar, color=color.green, style=shape.labelup, text="Bull Engulf")
plotshape(bearishEngulfing, title="Bearish Engulfing", location=location.abovebar, color=color.red, style=shape.labeldown, text="Bear Engulf")
plotshape(isHammer, title="Hammer", location=location.belowbar, color=color.blue, style=shape.labelup, text="Hammer")
plotshape(isShootingStar, title="Shooting Star", location=location.abovebar, color=color.orange, style=shape.labeldown, text="Shooting Star")

Explanation

Bullish/Bearish Engulfing: The script checks if a candle is larger than the previous one and if it engulfs the prior candle in the opposite direction.

Hammer and Shooting Star: It identifies these by checking the candle body position and ratio of wicks to body.


Adding Confirmation with RSI

You can also add RSI for further confirmation of potential reversals:

// RSI Setup
rsiSource = close
rsiLength = input.int(14, title="RSI Length")
rsiOverbought = input.int(70, title="Overbought Level")
rsiOversold = input.int(30, title="Oversold Level")
rsi = ta.rsi(rsiSource, rsiLength)

// Combine with RSI
bullishReversal = bullishEngulfing and rsi < rsiOversold
bearishReversal = bearishEngulfing and rsi > rsiOverbought

// Plot RSI confirmed signals
plotshape(bullishReversal, title="Bullish Reversal with RSI", location=location.belowbar, color=color.green, style=shape.labelup, text="Bullish")
plotshape(bearishReversal, title="Bearish Reversal with RSI", location=location.abovebar, color=color.red, style=shape.labeldown, text="Bearish")

Summary

This script uses basic candlestick reversal patterns and confirms them with RSI to highlight potential reversal points. You can tweak the parameters and add more patterns as needed. To refine this script further, consider adding more pattern types, moving averages, or volume conditions for stronger reversal signals.

The most effective trend patterns in trading are those that reliably indicate the continuation of an existing trend or a potential trend reversal. Here are some of the best-known trend patterns that traders use:

1. Flag and Pennant Patterns

Flag: Appears after a strong upward or downward movement. It forms a small rectangular or parallel channel that slopes slightly against the trend. The breakout from this pattern typically signals a continuation of the previous trend.

Pennant: Similar to a flag but forms a small, symmetrical triangle after a sharp price move. A breakout from the pennant also indicates trend continuation.


2. Ascending and Descending Triangles

Ascending Triangle: Formed by a horizontal resistance line and an upward-sloping support line. It suggests that buyers are gaining control, with an upward breakout likely.

Descending Triangle: Characterized by a downward-sloping resistance line and a horizontal support line, suggesting seller dominance. A downward breakout signals continuation in the direction of the trend.


3. Head and Shoulders (Trend Reversal)

Head and Shoulders: This reversal pattern has three peaks, with the middle peak (the “head”) higher than the two side peaks (“shoulders”). It’s a bearish pattern indicating the trend may reverse downward.

Inverse Head and Shoulders: A bullish reversal pattern that’s the opposite of the head and shoulders, indicating a potential reversal to the upside.


4. Double Top and Double Bottom

Double Top: Forms two consecutive peaks at approximately the same price level, indicating a bearish reversal after an uptrend.

Double Bottom: Forms two troughs at similar price levels, indicating a bullish reversal after a downtrend.


5. Cup and Handle

This is a bullish continuation pattern where the price forms a “U”-shaped cup, followed by a smaller consolidation or pullback (the handle). The breakout from the handle suggests a continuation of the upward trend.


6. Triangles (Symmetrical)

Symmetrical Triangle: Formed by converging trendlines of support and resistance. It indicates market indecision but typically resolves in the direction of the overall trend, making it a useful continuation pattern.


7. Wedges (Rising and Falling)

Rising Wedge: Forms as the price converges upwards with two upward-sloping trendlines. It’s typically a bearish reversal pattern, signaling a potential downside breakout.

Falling Wedge: Converges downward with two downward-sloping trendlines. It’s generally a bullish reversal pattern, indicating a possible breakout to the upside.


8. Rounding Bottom and Rounding Top

Rounding Bottom: A “U”-shaped pattern indicating a gradual reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. It suggests a prolonged reversal with upside potential.

Rounding Top: An inverted “U” pattern showing a gradual shift from uptrend to downtrend.


9. Channel Patterns (Ascending and Descending)

Ascending Channel: Consists of parallel upward-sloping support and resistance lines. It indicates a steady upward trend and can serve as a continuation pattern if the price remains within the channel.

Descending Channel: Consists of parallel downward-sloping support and resistance lines, indicating a downtrend and potential continuation if the price stays within the channel.


Using Trend Patterns Effectively

To increase the reliability of these trend patterns:

Combine with Indicators: Use momentum indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) to confirm pattern signals.

Volume Analysis: Look for increased volume at breakouts, which suggests a stronger trend continuation or reversal.

Identify Time Frames: Trend patterns on higher time frames (e.g., daily, weekly) are usually more reliable than those on shorter time frames.


These trend patterns can be very effective when combined with technical analysis and trading indicators to confirm breakouts, continuations, or reversals.
